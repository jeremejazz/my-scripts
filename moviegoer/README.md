## movie lookup automation script

Simple automation script for moviegoers (like me).
Will look up for movies of PH malls based on search input. I made this because the current website and app for movie lookup is riddled with ads (I'm looking at you ClickTheCity!)

ex: 
```
python moviegoer.py SM BF
```

If no parameters added, the script will prompt the user to enter the cinema name.
