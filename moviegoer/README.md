## movie lookup automation script

[Demo via Repl.it](https://moviegoer.jereme.repl.run/)

Simple automation script for moviegoers (like me).
Will look up for movies of PH malls based on search input. I made this because the current website and app for movie lookup is riddled with ads (I'm looking at you ClickTheCity!)

ex: 
```
python moviegoer.py SM BF

# or simply

./moviegoer.py Mall of Asia

```

If no parameters added, the script will prompt the user to enter the cinema name. 

```
./moviegoer.py

```

This script was designed to run in termux as an alternative to clickthecity app.
